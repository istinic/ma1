# Project Roadmap: Free Bridge Online

This document outlines the planned features and overall vision for the Free Bridge Online project.

## Current Focus (Phase 1)

Our immediate goal is to establish the core user interface and basic functionality.

- **Setup and Configuration**: Completed project setup and documentation.
- **Core UI Components**: Create foundational React components for the game, such as a `Card`, a `PlayerHand`, and a `GameTable`.
- **Basic Game State**: Implement a simple state management system to track player hands and turns.

## Short-Term Goals (Phase 2)

Once the core components are in place, we will focus on making the game playable.

- **Game Lobby**: Create a basic lobby where users can create or join a game.
- **Bidding System**: Implement a simple bidding box with basic rules validation.
- **Card Interaction**: Allow players to select and play cards.
- **Scorekeeping**: Build a rudimentary scoring system to track points per hand.

## Long-Term Vision (Phase 3+)

This is our ambitious vision for the future of the project.

- **Full Bidding Rules**: Implement a complete bidding system with all standard conventions.
- **AI Opponents**: Develop basic AI players to fill empty seats at a table.
- **Multiplayer Support**: Integrate real-time multiplayer functionality using WebSockets or a similar technology.
- **User Profiles**: Add user accounts, profiles, and historical game data.
- **Tournaments**: Create a system for organizing and running online tournaments.
