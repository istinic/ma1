# Configuration Template

This folder contains a **minimal, functional Webpack setup**. Its purpose is to serve as a **starting point** for a new environment.

### Features

- Minimal dependencies.
- Works out-of-the-box with `npm install` and `npm start`.
- Supports TypeScript, React, and basic CSS.

### Using This Template

1.  Select this template during the initial project setup script.
2.  Run `npm install` to install the basic dependencies.
3.  You can now manually modify the copied configuration files (`package.json`, `webpack.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`) to suit your needs.

For example, to convert this to a Vite setup, you would:

- Remove Webpack-related dependencies from `package.json`.
- Add Vite dependencies (`vite`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`).
- Update the scripts in `package.json` to use Vite commands.
- Create a `vite.config.js` file.
- Run `npm install` again to install the new dependencies.

### Status

This template provides a basic, working Webpack setup and is intended for customization.
