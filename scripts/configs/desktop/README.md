# Desktop Environment Setup (Vite)

This configuration is a modern setup designed for desktop development using **Vite**. It leverages Vite's lightning-fast development server and optimized build process.

### Setup Instructions

2.  Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies for Vite.

### Available Scripts

-   **`npm start`**: Starts the development server using Vite.
-   **`npm run build`**: Creates a highly optimized production-ready build.
-   **`npm lint`**: Runs both JavaScript and CSS linters.
-   **`npm fix`**: Automatically fixes linting and formatting issues.
-   **`npm test`**: Runs the test suite using Vitest.

### Dependencies

This environment requires:
-   `vite` and `@vitejs/plugin-react`
-   `typescript`
-   `eslint`
-   `stylelint`
-   `vitest` (for testing)
-   ...and other related plugins.

### Status
This Vite build has been successfully tested on a desktop environment and is confirmed to be working correctly.
